This program computes the gross weight and CG position for a larger aircraft
which may have many stations, and where the number of stations might vary

You will now enter your arm and weight values, remmember that there is
a weight limit

First, please enter the number of stations: 2
Please enter weight and arm (in weight,arm format) for station 1 : 365,39.12
You have successfully entered your weight and arm as 365.0lbs and 39.12inches.
The total weight of the system is: 365.0lbs
The center of gravity is 39.12 inches from the reference point
Warning: your CoG value is too far forward

Please enter weight and arm (in weight,arm format) for station 2 : 90, 42.22
You have successfully entered your weight and arm as 90.0lbs and 42.22inches.
The total weight of the system is: 455.0lbs
The center of gravity is 39.73318681318681 inches from the reference point
Warning: your CoG value is too far forward

Final Report::: 
There are 2 stations in total
The total weight of the system is: 455.0lbs
The center of gravity is 39.73318681318681 inches from the reference point
