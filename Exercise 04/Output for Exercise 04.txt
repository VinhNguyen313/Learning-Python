This program computes the gross weight and CG position for a larger aircraft
which may have many stations, and where the number of stations might vary

You will now enter your arm and weight values, remmember that there is
a weight limit

First, please enter the number of stations: 3
Please enter weight and arm (in weight,arm format) for station 1 : 1107.3,34.15
You have successfully entered your weight and arm as 1107.3lbs and 34.15inches.
The total weight of the system is: 1107.3lbs
The center of gravity is 34.15 inches from the reference point

Please enter weight and arm (in weight,arm format) for station 2 : 365,39.12
You have successfully entered your weight and arm as 365.0lbs and 39.12inches.
The total weight of the system is: 1472.3lbs
The center of gravity is 35.38211981253821 inches from the reference point

Please enter weight and arm (in weight,arm format) for station 3 : 90,42.22
You have successfully entered your weight and arm as 90.0lbs and 42.22inches.
The total weight of the system is: 1562.3lbs
The center of gravity is 35.77603213211292 inches from the reference point

Final Report::: 
There are 3 stations in total
The total weight of the system is: 1562.3lbs
The center of gravity is 35.77603213211292 inches from the reference point
